* [Intent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html) - How to use Intent to move to another Activity (eksplisit - inside same application. may be in the next commit, I'll show you how to open it in implisit way and how to bring data use Bundle)
* Utils - I've made 2 user defined utilizations in this project, such as Session and AesEncrypt. Please, explore these concept.
